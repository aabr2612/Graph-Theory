# Graph Theory Programs

This repository contains C++ programs that demonstrate various concepts in graph theory. The programs cover tasks like calculating vertex degrees, checking bipartiteness, and constructing adjacency and incidence matrices.

## Programs

1. **Vertex Degree Calculation**: 
   - Calculates the degree of each vertex in an undirected graph.

2. **In-Degree and Out-Degree Calculation**:
   - Computes the in-degree and out-degree for each vertex in a directed graph.

3. **Bipartite Graph Check**:
   - Checks if a graph is bipartite (can be colored with two colors).

4. **Adjacency Matrix Representation**:
   - Constructs an adjacency matrix for the graph.

5. **Unique Vertex Check**:
   - Ensures that all vertices are unique and constructs an adjacency matrix.

6. **Convert Adjacency Matrix to Edge List**:
   - Converts an adjacency matrix into a list of edges.

7. **Incidence Matrix Construction**:
   - Builds an incidence matrix for a graph.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
3. Run the desired program and follow the prompts to input graph data.
